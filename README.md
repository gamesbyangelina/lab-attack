lab-attack
==========

A small game in LibGDX+flixel-android, created for an Advanced Java Lecture.

Controls
==========

Arrow keys - move
Spacebar - fire

Collect all the MacGuffins, shoot or avoid the rats, and make it to the exit!
The exit appears when all the rats are killed, or when you collect all the sheets.
Each level has more rats or sheets in, and randomly changes. Will it get harder or easier? 

About The Game
==========

As you can tell within seconds of playing the game, it's no award-winner! I made it to showcase the maze generator we made in an Advanced Java Lecture I gave (check out the evomaze repository at github.com/gamesbyangelina) and to show how Reflection can be used to do cool things with games.
